A mutex is very powerful tool for a concurrent programming. We learned about it
in [the last blog post](/blog/2016/01/data-races.html). But inappropriate use of
mutexes can lead to serious problems. We will explore two of the most common
problems.

Forgetting to unlock
--------------------

The first problem is similar to the problem of spawning a thread and then
joining/detaching it. You must remember to call `{%raw%}.unlock(){%endraw%}`
member function every time you locked a mutex. This must also happen in the case
of exceptions.

Solution is the same as in joining the threads. We can use some sort of a Guard
object (recall [the `{%raw%}Guard{%endraw%}`
class](/blog/2015/12/why-threads-dangerous.html)). Luckily, the C++ Standard
Library has it already. It is the `{%raw%}std::lock_guard{%endraw%}`
class. Therefore, instead

{% highlight c++ %}
std::mutex m;
...
{
    m.lock();
    ...
    // some code
    ...
    m.unlock();
}
...
{% endhighlight %}

we do

{% highlight c++ %}
std::mutex m;
...
{
    std::lock_guard<std::mutex> guard(m);
    ...
    // some code
    ...
}
...
{% endhighlight %}

and the `{%raw%}guard{%endraw%}` object will automatically unlock the mutex when
its destructor is called. 

Deadlock
--------

Let's start to explore the deadlock with an example: 

John is picking up fruits at his garden and he ends up with a lot of fruits in a
bag. Unfortunately, he finds out that all of the pears are poisoned because of a
naughty neighbor. Therefore the pears must be thrown out!  However, the apples
are ok, so he decides to make an apple juice out of them using a grandmothers
famous recipe. The recipe requires at least 5 apples to make a refreshing juice.

Because John is a programmer, he decides to write a computer program, that will
"make the juice". Additionally, he notices that tasks: making the juice and
throwing away the pears could be done concurrently. Let's look through the
John's code. 

{% highlight c++ %}
std::mutex m_print;
std::mutex m_bag;

void makeAppleJuice(std::vector<std::string>& bag)
{
    std::lock_guard<std::mutex> printGuard(m_print);
    std::cout << "Making an apple juice..." << std::endl;

    std::lock_guard<std::mutex> bagGuard(m_bag);
    
    int numApples = 0;
    for (std::size_t i = 0; i != bag.size(); i++)
    {
        if (bag[i] == "a")
        {
            numApples++;
            bag[i] = "x";
        }
    }
    
    if (numApples < 5)
    {
        std::cout << "I can not make an apple juice." << std::endl;
    }
    else
    {
        std::cout << "I made an excellent apple juice for you." << std::endl;
    }
}
{% endhighlight %}

The input of `{%raw%}makeAppleJuice{%endraw%}` is a bag which contains apples
(`{%raw%}"a"{%endraw%}`) and pears (`{%raw%}"p"{%endraw%}`). 

We also have two mutexes: `{%raw%}m_print{%endraw%}`, which is associated to
printing, and `{%raw%}m_bag{%endraw%}` which is associated to the modification
of the bag. 

The function prints some information and removes the apples from the
bag. (An apple is removed by changing the bag entry from `{%raw%}"a"{%endraw%}`
to `{%raw%}"x"{%endraw%}`). Additionally, function counts the number of apples
and makes the juice only if the number of apples is greater than 5. 

The code for throwing out the pears is similar.

{% highlight c++ %}
void throwOutPear(std::vector<std::string>& bag)
{
    std::lock_guard<std::mutex> bagGuard(m_bag);
    
    for (std::size_t i = 0; i != bag.size(); i++)
    {
        if (bag[i] == "p")
        {
            bag[i] = "x";
        }
    }
    
    std::lock_guard<std::mutex> printGuard(m_print);
    std::cout << "I threw out all pears from you bag!" << std::endl;    
}
{% endhighlight %}

The for loop removes all pears from the bag. A pear is removed from the bag by
changing the bag entry from `{%raw%}"p"{%endraw%}` to
`{%raw%}"x"{%endraw%}`. Then, the function prints a messages.  Of course, the
mutexes protect the operations.

The main function

{% highlight c++ %}
void printItem(const std::string& fruit)
{
    std::cout << fruit << " ";
}


int main()
{
    std::vector<std::string> bag = {"a", "a", "a", "p", "p", "a", "p", "a"};
    
    std::thread t1(makeAppleJuice, std::ref(bag));
    std::thread t2(throwOutPear, std::ref(bag));
    t1.join();
    t2.join();

    std::cout << "Bag: ";    
    std::for_each(bag.begin(), bag.end(), printItem);
    std::cout << std::endl;
    
    return 0;
}
{% endhighlight %}

creates a bag and two threads for the two tasks. Finally, it also prints the
content of the bag.

But when we try to run it, we might get an unexpected behavior. If everything
goes well, the output is as following

{% highlight bash %}
$ ./deadlock 
Making an apple juice...
I made an excellent apple juice for you.
I threw out all pears from you bag!
Bag: x x x x x x x x 
{% endhighlight %}

But it might happen that you end up in an undesired situation.

{% highlight bash %}
$ ./deadlock 
Making an apple juice...
{% endhighlight %}

What is happening here? This is best explained with a picture.

![Deadlock](/pics/deadlock.png)

There are two resources: `{%raw%}std::cout{%endraw%}` and
`{%raw%}bag{%endraw%}`.  Both are protected by the two mutexes. The locks in the
picture represent the two mutexes.

 The thread `{%raw%}t1{%endraw%}` runs the function
`{%raw%}makeAppleJuice{%endraw%}` and locks the mutex associated with
printing. At the same time, the thread `{%raw%}t2{%endraw%}` runs the function
`{%raw%}throwOutPear{%endraw%}` an it locks the mutex associated with the
bag. 

At this point in time, both mutexes are locked. The picture symbolizes this when
both threads reach the locks and lock them. 

But `{%raw%}t1{%endraw%}`
would now like to lock `{%raw%}m_bag{%endraw%}`. The mutex is already locked, so
`{%raw%}t1{%endraw%}` can not lock it. Therefore, `{%raw%}t1{%endraw%}` waits for
`{%raw%}m_bag{%endraw%}` to be unlocked.

Similarly, `{%raw%}t2{%endraw%}` would like to lock
`{%raw%}m_print{%endraw%}`. But it is already locked. Therefore,
`{%raw%}t2{%endraw%}` also waits for `{%raw%}m_print{%endraw%}` to be
unlocked. Both threads are waiting for each other. And they will be waiting
forever.  The situation, when two threads are cyclically waiting on each other,
is called a **deadlock**.

How to avoid deadlocks?
-----------------------

There are many techniques that allow us to avoid the deadlocks.

* The simplest solution is to always lock the mutexes in the same order. 

* The `{%raw%}std::lock{%endraw%}` function can lock 2 or more mutexes at once
  without risk of a deadlock. Instead of having 
  {% highlight c++ %}
std::lock_guard<std::mutex> bagGuard(m_bag);
std::lock_guard<std::mutex> printGuard(m_print);
  {% endhighlight %}
  we make
{% highlight c++ %}
std::lock(m_print, m_bag);
std::lock_guard<std::mutex> printGuard(m_print, std::adopt_lock);
std::lock_guard<std::mutex> bagGuard(m_bag, std::adopt_lock);
{% endhighlight %}
   
   The std::lock locks both mutexes. Therefore, we need to pass additional argument
   to the `{%raw%}std::lock_guard{%endraw%}` constructor, which tells that the mutex
   has already been locked and the `{%raw%}lock_guard{%endraw%}` doesn't need to
   lock it again. 

* Never wait a thread if there is a chance that it is waiting for you. 

* Don't lock a mutex if you already locked another mutex. If you need to do it, do it
  with `{%raw%}std::lock{%endraw%}`.

* Generalization of locking the mutexes in the same order is to have a
  hierarchy of mutexes. Then you only lock a mutex if it is high/low enough in
  the hierarchy.
     
Summary
-------

We explored two problems regarding mutexes: forgetting to unlock and having a
deadlock. The deadlock is a problem when two threads are waiting for each other
indefinitely. Then, we looked at the techniques of avoiding deadlocks. The simplest
technique is to always lock the mutexes in the same order.

In the next blog post, we will look how can we return a value from a thread.
