The `{%raw%}std::thread{%endraw%}` does not provide an easy way to return a
value from a thread. We could do it via references but this approach
unnecessarily shares data between multiple threads and looks a bit cumbersome.

Another approach would be to use a condition variable from [the previous
article](/blog/2016/01/condition-variable.html). The condition variable is
associated with a condition and synchronizes threads when the condition is
fulfilled. In our case, the condition would be the end of a thread and the
result would be synchronized between the main and the spawned thread. It looks
like that this is a special type of condition. Using the condition variable for
returning from a thread seems like a big overhead. It must be some easier way to
do it.

Thankfully, the standard template library provides a mechanism to return from a
thread without using condition variables. The solution is to use **the futures**.

Futures
-------

Instead of creating a thread with a function and its arguments, we create a
future representation of the result. In other words: if we have a function

{% highlight c++ %}
int complicated_computation(double, bool);
{% endhighlight %}

we can create a thread.

{% highlight c++ %}
std::thread thread(complicated_computation, 2.5, true);
{% endhighlight %}

But now, we can not get the result of the function. Instead,
`{%raw%}std::async{%endraw%}` creates a future representation of the result

{% highlight c++ %}
std::future<int> future = std::async(complicated_computation, 2.5, true);
{% endhighlight %}

The template argument of the future is the return type of the function. In our
case, the template argument of the `{%raw%}future{%endraw%}` is
`{%raw%}int{%endraw%}`, because `{%raw%}complicated_computation{%endraw%}`
return type is `{%raw%}int{%endraw%}`.

We can get the result of the function by calling the `{%raw%}.get(){%endraw%}`
member function of the future.

{% highlight c++ %}
int result = future.get();
{% endhighlight %}

The `{%raw%}.get(){%endraw%}` blocks current thread until the
`{%raw%}complicated_computation{%endraw%}` returns the result.

Lets look at another example.

Temperature tomorrow
--------------------

The story is simple. A couple, wife and husband, are going on a picnic
tomorrow. The wife would like to know what will be the temperature of the
weather. Therefore, she asks her husband to look it up.

Again, keep in mind that the persons represent different threads (tasks). 

{% highlight c++ %}
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <chrono>

#include <thread>
#include <future>

void make_break(int milisec)
{
    std::this_thread::sleep_for(std::chrono::milliseconds(milisec));
}
{% endhighlight %}

We need to include `{%raw%}<future>{%endraw%}` in order to use them. Here is
also one helper function, which pauses current thread for a given number of
milliseconds. The purpose of this function is to better understand the execution
of the code.

The next section of the code represents the actions of the husband.

{% highlight c++ %}
int temperature()
{
    std::cout << "Husband: Hm, is the weather "
              << "forecast in the newspaper?\n" 
              << "         Eh, we don't "
              << "have a newspaper at home..." << std::endl;
    
    make_break(2);
    
    std::cout << "Husband: I will look it up on the internet!" << std::endl;
    
    make_break(2);
    
    std::cout << "Husband: Here it is, "
              << "it says tomorrow will be 40." << std::endl;
    
    return 40;
}
{% endhighlight %}

It prints some information and eventually returns `{%raw%}40{%endraw%}`. 

The last part of the code is the main function.

{% highlight c++ %}
int main()
{
    std::cout << "Wife:    Tomorrow, we are going on a picnic.\n" 
              << "         What will be the weather...\n" 
              << "         \"What will be the "
              << "temperature tomorrow?\"" << std::endl;
    
    std::future<int> answer = std::async(temperature);
    
    make_break(2);
    
    std::cout << "Wife:    I should pack for tomorrow." << std::endl;
    
    make_break(2);

    std::cout << "Wife:    Hopefully my husband can figure out the weather soon."
              << std::endl;
    
    int temp = answer.get();

    std::cout << "Wife:    Finally, tomorrow will be " << temp << "... Em...\n"
              << "         \"In which units is the answer?\"" 
              << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
{% endhighlight %}

The interesting parts of the code are construction of the
`{%raw%}std::future{%endraw%}` object by calling the
`{%raw%}std::async{%endraw%}` and acquisition of the temperature by calling the
`{%raw%}.get(){%endraw%}` member function of the future.

When we run the example, we might get the following result.

{% highlight c++ %}
$ ./future 
Wife:    Tomorrow, we are going on a picnic.
         What will be the weather...
         "What will be the temperature tomorrow?"
Wife:    I should pack for tomorrow.
Wife:    Hopefully my husband can figure out the weather soon.
Husband: Hm, is the weather forecast in the newspaper?
         Eh, we don't have a newspaper at home...
Husband: I will look it up on the internet!
Husband: Here it is, it says tomorrow will be 40.
Wife:    Finally, tomorrow will be 40... Em...
         "In which units is the answer?"
{% endhighlight %}

But this looks strange. The `{%raw%}temperature(){%endraw%}` started to run when
the `{%raw%}.get(){%endraw%}` member function of the `{%raw%}answer{%endraw%}`
was called. Therefore, the execution is not asynchronous. 

The readers might think: "Jaka, did you mislead us? The
`{%raw%}std::async{%endraw%}` doesn't create a new thread!" Well, I did mislead
you a little. The compiler can choose whether to run the function in a new
thread or synchronously. But don't despair. We can explicitly set our compiler
to use either one of the policies.

Std::launch policy
------------------

The `{%raw%}std::async{%endraw%}` has an optional first argument which
determines how the `{%raw%}std::async{%endraw%}` computes the value of the
future. We can choose between three values for the first argument.

#### *Asynchronous* ####


The first value, which enables asynchronous evaluation, is
`{%raw%}std::launch::async{%endraw%}` . This means that the computation
(of `{%raw%}temperature(){%endraw%}`) will always be in a new thread. Our
code would then look like

{% highlight c++ %} 
std::future<int> answer = std::async(std::launch::async, temperature); 
{% endhighlight %} 

and the next figure describes the timeline of the program in this case.

#### *Lazy* ####

The second value is `{%raw%}std::launch::deferred{%endraw%}` which enables lazy
evaluation. This means that the computation will be deferred until the
`{%raw%}.get(){%endraw%}` member function of the future will be called. This
happened in our example above. 

The advantage of this option is that the computation might never occur, if we
never call the `{%raw%}.get(){%endraw%}` member function. For this option, our
code would look like:

{% highlight c++ %}
std::future<int> answer = std::async(std::launch::deferred, temperature); 
{% endhighlight %}

The next figure describes the timeline of the program in this case. 

![Future1](/pics/future1.png)

#### *Default* ####

If we don't provide the optional argument, the compiler will use the default
value which is `{%raw%}std::launch::async | std::launch::deferred{%endraw%}`.
This means that either one of the upper two cases might happen. In the example
above, we didn't provide the optional argument and the implementation chose
`{%raw%}std::launch::deferred{%endraw%}`.

Summary
-------

We learned how to return a value from a thread with futures and
`{%raw%}std::async{%endraw%}`. `{%raw%}std::async{%endraw%}` has two options. 

* It can run a function in a separate thread.

* Or it can defer the execution of the function until the
  `{%raw%}.get(){%endraw%}` member function is called.
